Software product line engineering
=================================

Software product line engineering (SPLE) provides an efficient means to
produce software that is delivered to multiple customers, in bespoke form,
derived from a composable, reusable set of assets. Effective use of SPLE can
reduce defects, costs, and time to market by a factor of 10 or more. SPLE is
desirable in small- to medium-sized enterprises, where a common occurrence is
the introduction of a one-off product that proves to be popular, and over time
requires multiple customer-specific versions. However, in its more traditional
form (the proactive approach, with a focus on the long-term up-front domain
engineering phase), SPLE is not always viable for SMEs. Agile product line
engineering (APLE), the combination of SPLE and agile software development, is
a reactive approach to facilitating SPLE in SMEs that can cut down the
long-term investment of the domain engineering phase.
