Feature-oriented software development
*************************************

FOSD is a particular approach to SPLE that focuses strongly on the idea of features
and their representation througout the entire software lifecycle.

The book `Feature-Oriented Software Product Lines: Concepts and Implementation <http://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783642375200>`_
is a brilliant book on the topic.
