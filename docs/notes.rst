Notes
*****

* I don't think feature model features have to correspond directly to BDD features.
    * At least if we're using feature modules.  A feature module for a feature could contain multiple feature files.
    * Might not be as easy for the other implementation methods.

* Need to read up a little of features and scenarios - how logically related should scenarios be?
