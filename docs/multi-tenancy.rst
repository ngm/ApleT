Multi-tenancy
*************

Multi-tenancy is a common pattern in web application development,
for serving up to multiple "tenants" customised versions of the same
application.

All of the work on software product lines implementation applies to
multi-tenancy.  Most multi-tenant sites can be viewed as software
product lines, with the individual product being defined at load-time.
