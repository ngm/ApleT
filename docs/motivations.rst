Why do we need product line engineering for web applications?

.. epigraph::

    THE FOLLOWING STORY has happened thousands of times. A company puts a
    product on the market, and the product proves to be very successful. Customers
    use the product and it’s almost perfect, but it needs some changes to make it
    really fit the context in which it’s used. The company considers this and
    provides a customer-specific version. At the same time, on the basis of
    customer feedback, the company realizes that several customer segments would be
    better served with a product focused for each segment. So, the company ends up
    with a multitude of significantly similar product versions. 
    
    At this point, the company realizes that many of the required changes must
    be implemented for most or even all product versions and that implementing
    the same change multiple times is really inefficient, time-consuming, and
    error prone. This often results in the creation of a platform from which
    the different products and customer-specific versions can be derived. This
    significantly improves development efficiency. However, a new challenge
    enters the arena: managing the points in the platform where the product
    versions’ functionalities differ —- that is, variability management.

Why do we need to incorporate behaviour-driven development?

     ...much of the tremendous power of features is yet be unlocked by 
     making features explicit throughout the entire systems and software lifecycle

     -- Krzysztof Czarnecki, foreword to *Feature-Oriented Software Product Lines* [Apel2013]_

     The explicit treatment of features in requirements, architecture, implementation, and verification and 
     validation can greatly improve the management of software.

We wish to combine the benefits of BDD, SPLE and FOSD.

     "the idea of variability-aware analysis is not to invent new knds of analysis
      techniques, but to *lift* existing analysis techniques developed for individual
      programs to entire product lines (that is, to domain artifacts).”
