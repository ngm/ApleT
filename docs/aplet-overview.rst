ApleT Overview
==============

ApleT is a framework that helps you to create software product
lines using behaviour-driven development.

ApleT builds on the concepts of
:ref:`variability-awareness in behaviour-driven development artifacts <bdd-variability-implementation-techniques>`.

The :ref:`ApleT process <aplet-process>` describes the stages involved
in order to do this, including the roles, activities, and input and output
artifacts of each stage.

ApleT is designed to be used in various organisational contexts and different
software stacks.  The :ref:`ApleT toolchain <aplet-toolchain>` outlines a 
general toolchain required and gives examples of what provides these different 
tools in different stacks.
